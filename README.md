# Some experiments with SpinalHDL

## What is SpinalHDL

SpinalHDL is an open source high-level hardware description language. It can be used as an alternative to VHDL or Verilog and has several advantages over them.

## What is in this repository?

### src/main/scala/obijuan/

A number of expamples from the tutorial by Juan Gonzalez-Gomez (Obijuan)

> DiseÃ±o Digital para FPGAs, con herramientas libres  
> (Digital Design for FPGAs, with free tools)  
> <https://github.com/Obijuan/open-fpga-verilog-tutorial/wiki>

rewritten from Verilog to SpinalHDL and tested with
[iCE40-HX8K Breakout Board - Lattice
Semiconductor](http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/DevelopmentBoardsAndKits/iCE40HX8KBreakoutBoard.aspx).

### src/main/scala/shs/

A collection of various **S**pinal**H**DL **s**amples.

### src/main/scala/ice40hx8k/

A few other (silly) experiments with iCE40-HX8K.

## How to actually build and upload the designs to an FPGA board?

The Verilog programs generated by SpinalHDL can be built and
uploaded to iCE40-HX8K by means of the tools, provided by
<https://github.com/FPGAwars>.

## Prerequisits

In order for this stuff to be up and running, there has to be installed some
additional software. The details can be found at
